      <h1> Week 1</h1>
      <p>
      <h2>Monday May 22, 2017</h2>
      &emsp;In the morning, we met Dominic LiMandri from the San Leandro Downtown Association. He works alongside the city to make public spaces more inviting to businesses and the community. Dom's main role in our project is to speed up any of the civil beaurocratic processes. Our meeting was very casual and the discussion ranged from weighing the impact of our project on the community to laughing about the activities to do in San Leandro. Our end goal for the meeting was to clarify the problem that we are tackling. We covered a lot of the logistics and technical aspects about the project, but we learned that there are many facets of the city's maintenance that can be improved. We were surprised to find out that there are only four maintenance workers, three on some days, for the entire downtown area. They sweep, collect, and pressure wash the dirt and trash on the streets and sidewalks every day. Our project would reduce a lot of the labor that goes into cleaning downtown San Leandro. They would likely only have to check the trash cans about twice a day. We hope to roll out a fully functional unit by the end of 4 weeks.

      <h3>Logistics: notes from meeting with Dominic</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Start off with 10 units, then add more (about 40 total) if budget permits it</li>
        <li>$500 max per unit, but aim for less</li>
        <li>Trash cans bolted into ground</li>
        <li>Stainless steel outer body, separate plastic can inside</li>
        <li>Contract with ACI: they buy the trash cans for us</li>
        <li>Should be as easy to replace as previous trashcans</li>
        <li>Able to withstand daily beating of a regular trashcan</li>
        <li>Ideally, battery lasts over a month and should be easy maintenance</li>
        <li>Securely fixed to trash can to avoid robberies</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
      &emsp;After lunch, we did an inventory check of all of our hardware and made note of what else we needed. At PhaseSpace, we met some people who could help provide any of the tools that were necessary. We spent the rest of the day discussing the pricing on a software development kit from Paradox that could potentially cut down our development time from a month down to a week. The team will be meeting them on Wednesday. We obtained calibration data and studied the data sheets from the sensors we might use in order to weigh the pros and cons of using each. We then met with James, one of the PhaseSpace employees and a mentor to Herrick. He gave us technical advice on how to move forward with the project.
