          &emsp;After we called OSISoft, we started looking for the server that would be able to meet our requirements for the project. The basic specs that we are looking for in our server is a quad-core processor and 6-8 GB of RAM. We have created a Google Sheet that will organize our findings. Later in the day, we assigned one team member to making and designing footprints for the PE Stone Board. The other members of the team were assigned with completing the Django tutorial for application development in the future. Also, we found out more information regarding the project through Mario. We also finished the circuit diagram for the sensor.

        <p>
          &emsp;Today, we drew up the engineering schematics for the the sensor board. The engineering team also researched antennas for the board. The interns worked on finishing programming tutorials. Also, they were able to update the midro.github.io site to make it more organized and visually appealing. The software team started making the rough web app using Django. It will display the trash levels and more information. Below is the layout of the overall project that we are trying to accomplish.

        <p>
           &emsp;Today, we compiled code onto the development module. We also learned how to turn on the clocks on the microcontroller. The interns were assigned with finishing up their programming tutorials and searching for a microcontroller that runs on 3.3 volts. The interns were also able to update the Django site for the project with an info section that organizes information about each individual trash can, such as fill level and location. They were also able to change the google maps icon on the map to a trash icon instead of a red pin.

        We were able to pop out in the morning to watch the Golden State Warriors parade celebrating their 2017 NBA champion status. Go Warriors!

        The engineers began to figure out how to connect to a development board we received from Paradox Engineering. This board contains the PE.STONE module which we will use to connect to San Leandro's 6LoWPAN network. Additionally, we began planning the PCB (printed circuit board) to custom order manufactured.

        We also set up the software toolchain, which is a set of tools to compile the components to run the Paradox board, but ran into bugs.

        <h2>Friday June 16, 2017</h2>
        We had a morning meeting with people working in the city, Paradox, and even in Italy. Mario, our liason with Paradox, answered questions pertaining to the board and connecting to it. We also visited PhaseSpace to get some further help from James, our main mentor. He helped us find creative ways to connect to the STONE around the sensors already on Paradox's development board.
