      <h1>Mudders Innovating the Dro</h1>
      <p>
        This website was created to extensively document the
        endeavors of Priscilla Chu, Herrick Fang, Darien Joso, Sati Smyth,
        Elijah Whitsett, and Kayla Yamada during their time in the San Leandro
        Pilot City Incubator Program.
        <!--TODO: More on program-->
      </p>
      <h3>What is the Problem?</h3>
      <p>
        San Leandro is building itself to be a pilot city
        that others can look to as a model for growth and development. Thus, the
        city is constantly searching for optimal solutions to the various obstacles
        it may face. Our specific project deals primarily with expanding and
        optimizing waste management in downtown San Leandro. Currently there are
        20 trashcans in the downtown area--the city is planning to not only upgrade
        these trash cans, but also introduce at least 20 more. This sudden growth
        will create a labor DEFICIENCY, and necessitate the redistribution of funds
        from other vital departments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our solution is to leverage existing technologies to minimize the
        additional labor necessitated by this updated trash system. We
        intend for this solution to be available as a model for other cities to
        improve their own waste management systems.
      </p>
      <h3>What is the Approach?</h3>
      <p>
        We will connect sensor modules to monitor the levels of trash in these
        new trashcans and display this information on a website that workers can
        easily access. This webpage will allow the workers to quickly service the
        necessary trashcans without excessive labor. The sensor modules
        will connect to the city's 6LoWPAN network for further
        optimization. This network allows us to transmit information
        with much lower power and cost requirements than traditional forms of
        communication (such as WiFi or cellular networks). The data from the sensor
        modules can then be displayed on the webpage.
